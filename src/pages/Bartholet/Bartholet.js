The new developments offer even more ride comfort, higher capacities, improved efficiency, and low-noise operation. With Swiss Performance, maintenance work is significantly reduced. In addition, the new modular design enables simplified and fast assembly.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">Together with the Porsche Design Studio, Bartholet developed the modern and comfortable panoramic gondolas. Not only the appearance of the panoramic gondola is unique, but also the feeling of space is extraordinary. Passengers can enjoy the view through the extra-large panorama windows, optionally made of polycarbonate or safety glass.</span>

                            <img src="/bartholet3.jpeg" alt="Modular Station Concept" />
                            <span className="text-muted">The Bartholet stations are pre-assembled in modules from the factory. These are delivered in set packages to the construction site in order to complete a station as quickly as possible. This method reduces the assembly time and is efficient in series production. Stations are designed so that any work can be carried out ergonomically standing.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">In order to achieve more flexibility in the ropeway structure, the supports are also manufactured in modular design. Special suspension devices make both assembly and disassembly with a helicopter considerably easier. One and the same roller type is used on the track and on the stations. This translates to savings on maintenance costs including improvements on parts logistics.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">In the course of technical development, Bartholet has developed intelligent rollers. These are mounted at the beginning and end of the roller battery, and measures various relevant data. The intelligent roller has several sensors which evaluate: rope position, wear of bearing rings, condition of bearings in the rollers, lateral force due to winds, and deviations from the actual condition. </span>

                            <span className="text-muted">Bartholetâ€˜s Direct Drive clearly differs from the direct drives already available on the market. Conventional drive systems consist of a motor and a gearbox. With the Direct Drive developed by Bartholet, the power transmission goes directly to the pull wheel. The risk of a gear breakage is eliminated, and maintenance-intensive components such as the cardan shaft and gear are completely eliminated from the design.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">To date, Bartholet technology offers the smoothest rides for Aerial Ropeway Transport systems. The transitions along the pylons are smoother compared to other manufacturers. A Dual Feder System helps produce a smooth ride and rubber bearings eliminates high-frequency vibrations. The mechanical system was optimized, which leads to a smoother and more comfortable station entrance.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">Bartholet introduces the next generation of the Bartholet K3 clamp as part of the Swiss Performance initiative. The new clamp is more robust and has a maintenance-friendly design. Well thought-out solutions lead to an even greater reduction in revision and maintenance costs. It is the first clamp worldwide with a maximum rope diameter of 65 mm and it is the only clamp that allows a function check on the system when installed.</span>

                            <span className="text-muted">Bartholet offers various garage systems and expansion stages, depending on the space available and the financial requirements. The system differentiates between stitch track, loop, or station parking. Depending on customer requirements, garage parking can be manual, semi-automatic, or fully automatic. The convenient, fully automatic station parking system is the most space-saving variant in comparison to the classic vehicle parking systems. No additional constructions and components are required.  </span>
